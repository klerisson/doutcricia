			<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
			This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which LSI collects, uses,
			maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a
			"User") of the <a href="lsi.facom.ufu.br">lsi.facom.ufu.br</a>
			website. This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and
			services offered by LSI. <br> <br> <b>Personal
				identification information</b> <br> <br> We collect personal
			identification information from Users in a variety of ways,
			including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on
			the site, respond to a survey, and in connection with other
			activities, services, features or resources we make available on our
			Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, email address. Users
			may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal
			identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit
			such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally
			identification information, except that it may prevent them from
			engaging in certain Site related activities. <br> <br> <b>Non-personal
				identification information</b> <br> <br> We may collect
			non-personal identification information about Users whenever they
			interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may
			include the browser name, the type of computer and technical
			information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the
			operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and
			other similar information. <br> <br> <b>Web browser
				cookies</b> <br> <br> Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance
			User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard
			drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information
			about them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse
			cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so,
			note that some parts of the Site may not function properly. <br>
			<br> <b>How we use collected information</b> <br> <br>
			LSI may collect and use Users personal information for the following
			purposes: <br>
			<ul>
				<li><i>- To personalize user experience</i><br> We may use
					information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group
					use the services and resources provided on our Site.</li>
				<li><i>- To run a promotion, contest, survey or other Site
						feature</i><br> To send Users information they agreed to receive
					about topics we think will be of interest to them.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>How we protect your information</b> <br> <br> We adopt
			appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and
			security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration,
			disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username,
			password, transaction information and data stored on our Site. <br>
			<br> <b>Sharing your personal information</b> <br> <br>
			We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification
			information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic
			information not linked to any personal identification information
			regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted
			affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. <br>
			<br> <b>Compliance with children's online privacy protection
				act</b> <br> <br> Protecting the privacy of the very young is
			especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain
			information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and
			no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. <br>
			<br> <b>Changes to this privacy policy</b> <br> <br>
			LSI has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time.
			When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site.

			do not use our Site. Your continued use of the Site following the
			posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of
